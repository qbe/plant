.Sh DESCRIPTION
The program "plant" will read in any number of lines, and arrange them internally in an n-ary tree,
where each line is broken up into "identifiers" and "seperators", with the "seperators" specifiable via the argument "-r REGEX".

After the program receives the end-of-file signal or runs over the configured threshhold of objects in the tree,
it will start printing the tree in a visually pleasing and configurable manner.

The input should be in depth-first traversal manner(e.g. child items should come before siblings), which is automatically done
by pretty much any recursively working utility. Lexically sorting the input lines is not necessary, but will accomplish the depth-first traversal requirement for any input.
